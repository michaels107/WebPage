    Take Lane Avenue (going east into OSU) over the bridge until you reach Tuttle Park Place road. Take a right onto Tuttle Park Place road and continue down (shortly) through the big 4-way intersection (intersecting with Woody Hayes Dr.). Shortly after the intersection you will see a large parking garage on your left (with an immediate entrance into the garage from the road) named "Tuttle Garage" (2050 Tuttle Park Pl). The OSU Stadium will be directly on your right. Enter this garage and take the ticket to park your car (Note that there is a charge to park anywhere on campus).
</p>
<p>
    I am located in office 491 Dreese Labs, directly adjacent (behind) to the parking garage. It is the tallest red brick building in the immediate area. It also has a characteristic white "spool" on the very top of the building.
